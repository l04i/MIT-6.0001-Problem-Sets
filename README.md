# MIT 6.0001 Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets for the course MIT 6.0001 - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python. The problem sets are designed to provide hands-on programming practice and reinforce the concepts covered in the course.

## Course Description

MIT 6.0001 is an introductory course that teaches the fundamentals of computer science and programming using the Python programming language. The course covers topics such as variables, control structures, functions, recursion, data structures, and algorithm analysis.


Each problem set's solutions are contained within a separate directory named "PSX", where X represents the problem number.
