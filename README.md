I apologize for the misunderstanding. Here's an example of a README file for a repository containing your solutions for the MIT 6.0001 problem sets:

# MIT 6.0001 Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets for the course MIT 6.0001 - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python. The problem sets are designed to provide hands-on programming practice and reinforce the concepts covered in the course.

## Course Description

MIT 6.0001 is an introductory course that teaches the fundamentals of computer science and programming using the Python programming language. The course covers topics such as variables, control structures, functions, recursion, data structures, and algorithm analysis.


Each problem set's solutions are contained within a separate directory named "PSX", where X represents the problem number. 

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MIT-6.0001-Problem-Sets.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

```
cd MIT-6.0001-Problem-Sets
```

3. Explore the problem sets and their corresponding solutions.


## Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge MIT for creating the course MIT 6.0001 and providing the problem sets for practice.
